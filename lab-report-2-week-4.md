The faliure-inducing input here is a file where there are some random words in between the closing square bracket of the file link and it's open parenthesis. Since there are words here and it is not the correct syntax we should see only one link but we do see two of them when we look for symptoms. So, we change the code and add an ```if``` statement to make sure that the opening parenthesis is right after the closing square bracket. Now, we will get our desired output.
